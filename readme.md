The goal of this project was to determine if there was a tangible relationship between a sentiment analysis of Twitter and stock pricing. Multiple machine learning algorithms were used to examine this relationship. Unfortunately, only a weak correlation was found with the data used, not enough to make any reasonable predictions off of.
